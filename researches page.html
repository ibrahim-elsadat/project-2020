                        Unregulated cell growth seems to be a driver behind the growth of atherosclerotic plaques, changing the traditional story of plaque formation. The rapid cell growth in the arterial wall is similar to pre-cancerous growth in other tissues. JUN 19 2020
                        Illustration of atherosclerosis Atherosclerotic plaques are unhealthy masses of oxidized cholesterol, immune cells and dead tissue that form within arterial walls. sciencepics/Shutterstock.com For decades, the standard story of
                        how atherosclerotic plaque forms focused on the accumulation of cholesterol and inflammatory cells in arterial walls. Now, researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine have identified another factor that initiates the formation
                        of these plaques: inflamed smooth muscle cells in the linings of arterial walls that multiply in an unregulated way. The culprit behind many heart attacks and strokes, atherosclerotic plaques are unhealthy masses of oxidized cholesterol,
                        immune cells and dead tissue that form within arterial walls. When atherosclerotic plaques grow large or rupture they can impede blood supply to vital tissues and organs, making them a lethal threat. “Cardiovascular disease remains
                        the world’s No. 1 killer, despite widespread use of cholesterol-lowering medicines,” said Nicholas Leeper, MD, professor of surgery at Stanford. “Recent studies have indicated that the standard dogma about how atherosclerosis happens
                        wasn’t really capturing the whole story.” In 1973, researchers proposed that a substantial portion of atherosclerotic plaques were made up of arterial blood vessel cells that had expanded over time, and that these abnormally growing
                        cells could be driving the growth of the plaque. But for decades, that idea was sidelined in favor of findings pointing to the importance of cholesterol in plaque formation. Renewed interest in old finding Recently, Leeper and
                        his colleagues renewed their interest in the old finding. They demonstrated that these abnormal blood vessel cells were protected from removal by the immune system, indicating that the cells could be part of the disease process
                        underlying plaque formation. To find out how these rapidly proliferating cells arise, sparking the chain of events that leads to plaque formation, Leeper and his colleagues looked at blood vessel muscle cells in a plaque using
                        “rainbow” mice, which can be triggered so that every cell in their bodies expresses a particular color of a fluorescent protein. A single cell can be marked the color red, for instance. As it and its offspring divide, all the exact
                        copies, or clones, that arise will colored red. The researchers showed that early in the formation of a plaque, a single cell in the smooth muscle cell layer of the artery starts to proliferate more than it should, leading to the
                        growth of a lesion in the vessel wall that can constrict blood flow. Normally, such poorly regulated cell growth can be controlled by immune cells that eat the outlaw cells. But in addition to losing regulatory features that control
                        cell growth, the smooth muscle cells arm themselves with CD47, a cell marker that gives off a “don’t eat me” signal to immune cells. test Nicholas Leeper “The combination of hyperproliferative growth and increased expression of
                        ‘don’t eat me’ signals that frustrate immune mechanisms that would otherwise control them give these cells a competitive advantage over normal smooth muscle cells,” Leeper said. A paper describing the research was published online
                        June 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Leeper is the senior author. Postdoctoral fellow Ying Wang, PhD, is the lead author. ‘Spewing out inflammatory factors’ Leeper and his colleagues identified an additional
                        characteristic of these rogue cells that leads to plaque formation. “The cells are not only proliferating in an uncontrolled way, they are also spewing out inflammatory factors,” Leeper said. When the researchers looked at the
                        genes turned on and off in proliferating cells, they found that they produced high levels of a molecule called C3, a key part of the immune system that pumps up immune activity and inflammation. A systemic increase in C3 is known
                        to be a risk factor in cardiovascular disease. Moving beyond the mouse model and into human patients, they confirmed that C3 production is increased in a subset of smooth muscle blood vessel cells in human plaques. Finally, the
                        researchers analyzed plaque samples from patients with coronary artery disease and confirmed that human plaques had cells that had gene expression profiles similar to those of the plaque-initiating smooth muscle cells in the mouse
                        model. “This research confirms that plaques are founded on a clone of arterial smooth muscle cells that are rapidly dividing, evading immune control, and producing prodigious amounts of pro-inflammatory signals,” Leeper said. The
                        unregulated clonal expansion of cells in atherosclerotic plaques parallels that of poorly regulated cell growth in cancerous or pre-cancerous tissues, the researchers said. “The clonal expansion of smooth muscle cells looks a lot
                        like what we find in other pre-cancerous diseases like myelodysplastic syndrome,” which is caused by a clone of blood-forming stem cells taking over the blood forming system, said professor Irving Weissman, MD, a co-author on the
                        paper and the Virginia and DK Ludwig Professor for Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research. “In theory, given enough time, this might become a cancer of the arteries, but it kills people through plaque formation long before that.”
                        Similarity to cancer cells Cancer cells exhibit the same increase in CD47 “don’t eat me” signals that prevent them from being consumed by immune cells. Research in Weissman’s laboratory and evidence from clinical trials have shown
                        that blocking the CD47 signal leads the immune system to attack cancer cells, and Leeper’s group has shown that blocking CD47 could also lead to reduction in the size of atherosclerotic plaques. “If we block the CD47 signaling,
                        these plaques start to go away,” Leeper said. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy to block CD47 signaling, but anti-CD47 therapies are in clinical trials as a cancer therapy. Clinical trials of anti-CD47 therapy against
                        atherosclerosis are likely to follow, Leeper said. Researchers are also still working to understand how the unregulated blood vessel cell growth relates to the accumulation of cholesterol and other materials in plaques. Leeper
                        said that the proliferative smooth muscle cell model of atherosclerotic plaque formation has implications that point to other possible treatments. “These multiplying cells can give rise to different varieties of smooth muscle cell,
                        some bad and some good,” Leeper said. “In the future we may be able to bias the reproduction of these cells away from the bad, toward the good.” Other Stanford scientists involved in the research are postdoctoral scholars Vivek

                        The UK is home to world-class expertise and capability in global health and infectious disease. Since the 2002 SARS outbreak, UKRI has invested £25 million in research activities related to coronaviruses, meaning that we have a strong community ready
                        to respond to the current pandemic. UKRI-funded research has already shaped our understanding of the outbreak and is playing a vital role in informing measures to tackle it. The UK has a world-renowned team of clinicians, public
                        health experts and scientists working round the clock to keep the country safe. Many of these are supported by the MRC, which makes long-term investments in Institutes, Centres and Units that provide national centres of scientific
                        expertise. These include groups that have been able to quickly apply their relevant expertise to do research on the SARS-CoV2 and provide relevant advice for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. MRC-funded research centres The MRC Centre
                        for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, directed by Professor Neil Ferguson, is at the forefront of delivering timely analysis to inform policy responses to emerging infectious disease threats The Centre was rapidly awarded an
                        additional £500,000 to support its real-time analysis and modelling of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and the impact of COVID-19. The MRC Centre for Virus Research at the University of Glasgow (CVR) represents the UK’s largest grouping
                        of human and veterinary virologists. The Centre has contributed expertise to recent Ebola outbreaks, and is now working on SARS-CoV2 with £500,000 of supplementary funding. Working in collaboration with the NHS Greater Glasgow
                        & Clyde West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre, CVR researchers completed the genomic sequencing and analysis of Scotland’s first confirmed Covid-19 case within 48 hours of diagnosis. The MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation
                        Unit at the University of Dundee, working in partnership with the CVR, has identified 38 separate proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 –the virus that causes COVID-19 – that produce an immune response in the body. The Dundee team is
                        manufacturing these components of the virus in order to generate antibodies against them. When available, the Unit will place these on its reagent website, so that researchers worldwide can easily order these tools. The MRC Laboratory
                        for Molecular Biology (LMB) is deploying its world-leading expertise in high resolution microscopy and structural biology to interrogate how the virus enters and replicates in cells. This includes making different kinds of disabled
                        viruses, so-called ‘pseudotyped’ viruses, that contain the spike (S) protein from SARS-CoV-2, which is used for cellular entry, but no viral genes, to allow scientists to safely study how the spike protein gets the virus into cells.
                        In addition, LMB teams are studying how the immune system responds to the S protein and other viral proteins that are important for vaccine and therapeutic antibody design. The MRC Units in The Gambia and Uganda are also key to
                        the global effort. The Francis Crick Institute has initiated a multidisciplinary research response to the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying their researcher’s wide-ranging expertise in studying the underpinning biology of the virus,
                        the production of recombinant proteins from the virus as a resource for immunological studies, chemical inhibitor screening, mechanistic studies, and their work in identifying the most effective treatments for people with severe
                        disease. The Pirbright Institute The Pirbright Institute, strategically funded by BBSRC and home to the BBSRC National Virology Centre, has a long history of research on livestock coronaviruses including porcine coronaviruses and
                        infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that affects poultry. Previously, Pirbright had not carried out research on human coronaviruses, but is now working closely with many other science and health organisations to devise ways to control
                        and prevent COVID-19 in order to protect human health. This is part of Pirbright’s mission to protect the UK from livestock diseases and those that spread from animals to humans. Working in collaboration with the researchers at
                        the University of Oxford and PHE, a team of scientists at Pirbright will begin testing new vaccines for their ability to induce protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. UPDATED 29/5: Roslin Institute leads research on COVID-19's
                        impact on human body Dr Kenneth Baillie from the Roslin Institute is leading an MRC-funded project to improve our understanding of COVID-19 and how it affects the human body. The project is collecting samples and data from 1300
                        COVID-19 patients in the UK. The results will provide real-time information about the virus, and could help control the outbreak and improve treatments for patients. The team will use the data to discover who is at a higher risk
                        of severe illness, the best way to diagnose the disease and what happens in patients’ immune systems to help or harm them when they contract COVID-19. They will also monitor the effects of drugs used in patients, calculate how
                        long people are infectious, and investigate whether people are infected with other viruses at the same time. Dr Baillie is working in partnership with researchers from Imperial College London, the University of Liverpool and the
                        MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR) on the study. Decoding the genome of COVID-19 UKRI, through the MRC and in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Care and the Wellcome Trust, is backing the
                        UK’s leading clinicians and scientists to map how COVID-19 spreads and behaves by using whole genome sequencing. Through a £20 million investment, the consortium will look for insights that help the UK respond to this and future
                        pandemics. The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium comprises the NHS, public health agencies, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and numerous academic institutions. It will deliver large-scale, rapid sequencing of the virus and share intelligence
                        with hospitals, regional NHS centres and the government. By looking at the whole virus genome in people who have had confirmed cases of COVID-19, scientists can monitor changes in the virus at a national scale. This will help us
                        understand how the virus is spreading, whether different strains are emerging and whether changes in the virus affect the severity of disease. Using health data in research Health Data Research UK, the national institute for health
                        data science supported by UKRI, has been actively championing the use of health data to address the COVID-19 challenge. Current work at HDR-UK includes research on risk factors, genomics, clinical trials, care pathways and surveillance
                        while forging partnerships with government, NHS, industry and academia. These key activities are captured on the HDR UK COVID-19 Activities + Skills Matchmaking Tool, an online spreadsheet. HDR-UK are also implementing a prioritisation
                        system to ensure that resources are appropriately directed to where they are needed. This strategy will ensure that the best of the UK’s health data science capability will be leveraged to address the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerate
                        access to UK-wide priority datasets, and coordinate and connect a national data science driven research effort across the UK. More details on how HDR-UK are coordinating their response to COVID-19/. NIHR and UKRI launch call for
                        research on COVID-19 and ethnicity Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre suggest that 34% of critically ill coronavirus patients are from BAME backgrounds. According to the 2011 Census, 14% of the population
                        in England and Wales are from BAME backgrounds. There are concerns that healthcare and other key workers who belong to BAME groups may be particularly at risk. The NIHR and UKRI are calling for research proposals to investigate
                        emerging evidence of an association between ethnicity and COVID-19. We want to understand any potential differences in risks for ethnic groups, such as whether some groups are at a greater risk of adverse outcomes, and how we might
                        then reduce their morbidity and mortality. Coordinating research The UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) brings together major UK funders of global health research, and supports an Epidemics Preparedness and Response
                        Group, which involves five UKRI councils (MRC, AHRC, BBSRC, ESRC and NERC), DHSC, the Department for International Development, Wellcome and the Academy of Medical Sciences. The Group is currently helping to coordinate UK research
                        efforts against COVID-19, including through establishing an international database of COVID-19 research awards. The MRC is also contributing to the coordination of international research efforts via two international coordinating
                        bodies formed to improve the global response to epidemic threat: The WHO’s Global Coordinating Mechanism for Research and Development (GCM) and the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R). The
                        numbers game: using maths to combat coronavirus With support from EPSRC, mathematicians from The University of Manchester are using their computer modelling expertise to advise the government on how to best protect the UK population
                        during the coronavirus emergency. To better predict the future, they are looking back to historic pandemics like the bubonic plague for clues on infection patterns. With a focus on the risk to communities in enclosed places such
                        as prisons and cruise ships, their work has informed the scientific and technical advice that led COBRA, the government’s national emergency team, such as which makes decisions such as to when to order school closures, and on advice
                        to the public about staying in isolation. The supercomputer solution UKRI-supported researchers are using the power of high-performance computers (HPCs) in the fight against the COVID-19 virus. By enabling scientists to develop
                        a molecular-level understanding of the virus through sophisticated models and simulations, HPCs are helping to force COVID-19 to give up its secrets – such as how it can bind to and infect healthy cells. This work will help pave
                        the way for new diagnostics, therapies, antiviral drugs and vaccines. The EPSRC-supported HECBioSim and CCP-BioSim networks are playing a leading role in promoting the use of HPC resources for biomolecular simulation research into
                        the virus. HECBioSim provides access to the EPSRC-led ARCHER UK National Supercomputing Service, prioritising access for teams working on COVID-19 research. Both networks are working to link with researchers globally, and serve
                        as a global online resource, providing links to open-source software, supporting best practice and fostering knowledge-sharing and data sharing. Scientific computing – key to understanding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 The global
                        research community has responded quickly to the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Immediately following the Chinese government’s release of the genetic sequence, in early January 2020, structural biologists
                        around the globe swung into action to determine the three-dimensional structures of the proteins produced by the virus. These will form the basis for efforts to find inhibitor drugs and vaccines. The Scientific Computing Department
                        of UKRI’s Science & Technology Facilities Council is part of this international response, and is coordinating two international projects, CCP-EM and CCP4, funded by MRC and BBSRC, which are using electron cryo-microscopy and crystallography
                        respectively to provide information about the structure of the virus, including the spike protein that hooks on to the human cell, which is the principle target for vaccine development. This information will be crucial for virologists,
                        both in the laboratory and for subsequent computational analysis, and is already being used in trials based on synthetic versions of the protein. Other CCP (Collaborative Computational Project) communities are also providing time,
                        resources and expertise to support the international response. Find out more here about how the Scientific Computing Department is supporting research into SARS-CoV-2. STFC's Hartree Centre speeds up search for Coronavirus treatment
                        Supercomputers at STFC’s Hartree Centre at Daresbury Laboratory are speeding up the search to find the best existing antiviral drugs that are most effective for treating for COVID-19 – and anyone with a personal computer can help!
                        The Folding@home project, led by the Washington University School of Medicine, is asking people across the globe to lend any unused background capacity from their PCs to power simulations that will give a better understanding of
                        proteins and how they behave. Seeing a protein in action could be key to identifying drugs already in existence that could potentially treat or disrupt the virus. STFC’s Hartree Centre is providing its supercomputing capabilities
                        to help design and generate potential drugs at speed, enabling them to be distributed more quickly across the network of thousands of Folding@home users and, most importantly, get results faster. The team

                    Megan Matthews thought she was dying. "I thought my head was blown off," said Matthews, 22, who was hit in the eye with a sponge-tipped projectile fired by law enforcement at a May 29 protest in Denver. "Everything was dark. I couldn't see." Matthews,
                    a soft-spoken art major who lives with her mother, had gone to the demonstration against police brutality carrying bandages, water bottles and milk so she could provide first aid to protesters. "I couldn't really grasp how bad my injury
                    was," said Matthews, who sustained injuries including a broken nose, fractured facial bones and multiple lacerations on her face. "So much blood was pouring out. I was wearing a mask, and the whole mask was filling up with blood. I
                    was trying to breathe through it. I kept telling myself, 'Don't stop breathing.'" Three weeks later, Matthew is struggling with her vision and her doctor says she may never completely heal. Others fared far worse. In a joint investigation
                    into law enforcement actions at protests across the country after George Floyd's death in police custody, KHN and USA TODAY found that some officers appear to have violated their department's own rules when they fired "less lethal"
                    projectiles at protesters who were for the most part peacefully assembled. Critics have assailed those tactics as civil rights and First Amendment violations, and three federal judges have ordered temporary restrictions on their use.
                    At least 56 protesters sustained serious head injuries, including a broken jaw, traumatic brain injuries and blindness, based on news reports, interviews with victims and witnesses and a list compiled by Scott Reynhout, a Los Angeles
                    researcher. Photos and videos posted on social media show protesters with large bruises or deep gashes on the throat, hands, arms, legs, chest, rib cage and stomach, all caused by what law enforcement calls "kinetic impact projectiles"
                    and bystanders call "rubber bullets." At least 20 people have suffered severe eye injuries, including seven people who lost an eye, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Photographer Linda Tirado, 37, lost an eye after
                    being hit by a foam projectile in Minneapolis. Brandon Saenz, 26, lost an eye and several teeth after being hit with a "sponge round" in Dallas. Leslie Furcron, 59, was placed in a medically induced coma after she was shot between
                    the eyes with a "bean bag" round in La Mesa, California. Twenty-seven-year-old Derrick Sanderlin helped defuse a confrontation at a protest in San Jose, California, on May 29. While he was trying to protect a young woman from police,
                    he was hit with a projectile that ruptured a testicle and, his doctor said, may leave him infertile. With terms like "foam," "sponge" and "bean bag," the projectiles may sound harmless. They're not. "On day one of training, they tell
                    you, 'Don't shoot anywhere near the head or neck,'" said Charlie Mesloh, a certified instructor on the use of police projectiles and a professor at Northern Michigan University. "That's considered deadly force." Floyd's death sparked
                    the nation's most widespread street protests in decades, drawing a massive response from police dressed in riot gear. Although many large metropolitan police departments own these projectiles, they had never before been used on a national
                    scale, Mesloh said. Witnesses say law enforcement in several major cities used less-lethal projectiles against nonviolent protesters, shot into crowds, aimed at faces and fired at close range — each of which can run counter to policies.
                    Police have said they fired these weapons to protect themselves and property in chaotic, dangerous scenes. These projectiles, intended to incapacitate violent aggressors without killing them, have evolved from the rubber bullets developed
                    in the 1970s by the British military to quell uprisings in Northern Ireland. They are designed to travel more slowly than bullets, with blunt tips meant to cause pain but not intended to penetrate the body. They come in many forms,
                    including cylindrical wooden blocks, bullet-shaped plastic missiles tipped with stiff sponge or foam, fabric sacks filled with metal birdshot, and pepper-spray balls, which are about the size of a paintball and contain the active chemical
                    in pepper spray. Some are fired by special launchers with muzzles the diameter of a cardboard toilet-paper roll; others can be fired from shotguns. They can cause devastating injuries. A study published in 2017 in the medical journal
                    BMJ Open found that 3% of people hit by projectiles worldwide died. Fifteen percent of the 1,984 people studied were permanently injured. "Given the inherent inaccuracy" of the projectiles and the risk of serious injury, death and
                    misuse, the authors concluded they "do not appear to be an appropriate means of force in crowd-control settings." Yet manufacturers continue to market them on their websites for that purpose. Defense Technology says its "eXact iMpact"
                    sponge projectile is "used for crowd control, patrol and tactical applications." PepperBall says the uses for its projectiles include "anti-riot" and "crowd control." Security Devices International describes its "blunt impact projectiles"
                    like weapons of war, saying they're "designed for military, peacekeeping, homeland security, law enforcement, correctional services and private sector security." It adds, "they are ideal for crowd control." The companies did not respond
                    to requests for comment. There are no national standards for police use of less-lethal projectiles and no comprehensive data on their use, said Brian Higgins, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New
                    York. So the nation's more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies establish their own rules for when they should be used, who's allowed to fire them and how to hold their officers accountable. Many police departments don't require officers
                    to document their use of projectiles, Higgins said, making it difficult to know how often they're used. Denver's policy says officers should use projectiles only on a "combative or physically resistive person whose conduct rises at
                    least to the level of active aggression," to prevent others from being harmed, or to "incapacitate a suicidal person who cannot be safely controlled with other force." Denver also forbids officers from targeting the "head, eyes, throat,
                    neck, breasts of a female, genitalia or spinal column" of a suspect "unless deadly force is warranted." Matthews said she was standing 5 feet from other peaceful protesters at the Denver demonstration and nowhere near anyone rowdy.
                    She suspects her shooting was no accident. "Either they targeted her face or they fired indiscriminately at the crowd," said Ross Ziev, Matthews' lawyer. "Either way, that poses a tremendous safety hazard." A federal lawsuit accuses
                    Denver police of "targeting protesters, press, and medics" and aiming projectiles "at the heads and groins of individuals, in a clear tactic to inflict maximum damage, pain and distress." The Denver Police Department "takes complaints
                    of inappropriate use of force seriously and has initiated Internal Affairs investigations into officers' actions during demonstrations that may be violations of policy," a department spokesman said. A federal judge in Denver issued
                    a temporary order limiting the use of projectiles and tear gas. Police may use them only with the approval of a supervisor — and only to respond to "specific acts of violence or destruction of property that the command officer has
                    personally witnessed." In his ruling, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson found a "strong likelihood" that Denver police violated protesters' constitutional rights "in the form of physical injury and the suppression of speech." The
                    Denver Police Department "has failed in its duty to police its own," Jackson wrote. Judges in Seattle and Dallas have issued similar injunctions, and cities such as San Jose, Atlanta and Austin have moved to curb their use. 'We've
                    opened the floodgates' As of 2013, 37% of police departments in the U.S. authorized the use of "soft projectiles," according to the most recent survey released by the U.S. Department of Justice. That included the largest police departments
                    in the country and more than half of those serving 10,000 or more citizens. Law enforcement used the projectiles widely during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by the death of black teenager Michael Brown. But in day-to-day
                    policing in the United States, kinetic impact projectiles are rarely used, according to a study published in 2018. Fewer than 1% of police use-of-force incidents involved such weapons, researchers found. Something changed when protests
                    erupted after George Floyd's death, said Higgins, a former police chief of Bergen County, New Jersey. "It's almost like we've opened the floodgates," Higgins said. In general, instructors teach officers to target only people who are
                    "extremely dangerous," said Higgins, who teaches classes on how to use these munitions. Projectiles should be "your last resort before you go to lethal force," Higgins said. "That's how dangerous they are." And officers need to aim
                    shotguns or launchers carefully. "You should never fire indiscriminately into a crowd," Higgins said. "You should always pick your target." Projectiles can be fired directly at a target, while "skip rounds" are fired at the ground
                    in the hope of hitting the target as they ricochet upward. That method of shooting is notoriously inaccurate, Mesloh said. Mesloh said he has spoken out about the problems with police projectiles for years, to little effect. There
                    are no manufacturing standards or quality control measures for less-lethal projectiles, Mesloh said. In field tests, he has found that bean bag rounds can travel far faster than advertised. He focused on rounds that were supposed to
                    fly out of a shotgun at 250 to 300 feet per second, 2½ to 3 times faster than a major league fastball. Several traveled 600 feet per second. One bean bag clocked in at 900 feet per second, about the same speed as a .45-caliber bullet,
                    he said. Faster projectiles are more likely to kill than slower ones, and they fly straighter. So an officer who expects the projectile will dip and hit a suspect's leg could end up hitting him on the torso or head, Mesloh said. Police
                    can also make dangerous errors if they shoot projectiles while wearing gas masks. "The visibility with gas masks is zero," Mesloh said. "I wouldn't want to shoot anything while wearing one." Instructors typically get eight hours of
                    training with less-lethal projectiles before they're allowed to teach others. Their students — regular police officers — receive four hours of instruction, including just five or six practice shots. Bean bag rounds used with shotguns
                    cost $6 each, which limits how many can be used for training, Mesloh said. Police and their advocates emphasize that officers dealing with crowds must make high-stakes decisions in chaotic situations without time for reflection. Often
                    they fear for their physical safety, said Nick Rogers, a detective and the president of the Denver police union. "Unfortunately, the narrative of the protests has kind of been hijacked," he said. "We probably had 30 to 40 police suffering
                    injuries from bricks and rocks. And that's not being reported." Denver police didn't respond to a request to confirm that. In San Jose, police Capt. Jason Dwyer said firing projectiles is safer than trying to control a crowd using
                    nightsticks. Dwyer, who was struck by a rock, said at a press conference that police were justified using projectiles and tear gas against the crowd, who turned his city into a "war zone." "I've been a cop for 21 years, spent about
                    half that time in special operations," Dwyer said. "But I can tell you, I've never seen anything like it." A South Carolina law enforcement leader defended the response against protesters in Columbia on May 31, a clash that included
                    the firing of projectiles. "There was no doubt what their intent was, and that was to destroy property, police cars, police buildings, whatever," Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said during a news conference. "So we had to stop them.
                    And we did stop them." But Patrick Norris, 28, said he was protesting peacefully when he was shot in the back. He and a group of 150 to 200 protesters were met by about 50 officers from the Columbia Police Department, Richland County
                    Sheriff's Department and the South Carolina Department of Corrections, according to a federal lawsuit Norris filed against the sheriff, the sheriff's department, the city of Columbia and its police department and unnamed officers with
                    the agencies and the state Department of Corrections. Court summonses have been issued to the defendants, who have not yet filed responses. Officers carried protective shields and were clad in body armor and riot helmets, said Norris,
                    a truck driver and veteran of marriage equality rallies and gay pride parades. For about two minutes, the protesters chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot," Norris said. Then it appeared that someone ordered the officers to move forward.
                    Almost instantly, the scene escalated into a battle. "They met us with immediate and intense force for no reason," Norris said. "It was pure chaos, with a large group of armed people unloading on unarmed protesters." Related Stories

                    had thrown objects at the law enforcement officers and tried to sneak into Columbia Police Department headquarters. Norris scoffed at that. He said he saw a bright flash, followed by a loud explosion that left shrapnel injuries on
                    one of his legs. "Multiple loud pops were heard," believed to have been "the first of the rubber bullets fired into the crowd by unknown law enforcement officers," the lawsuit alleged. "Officers then began shooting tear gas canisters
                    into the crowd of protestors," the lawsuit said. Norris, who had turned to run, "was struck numerous times in the back" by projectiles that left red welts seen in photos included with the lawsuit. The Columbia Police Department policy
                    on the use of force states that less-lethal weapons meant to be fired directly at a target can't be used indiscriminately against a crowd, even if it's violent, and "shall not be used for crowd management, crowd control or crowd dispersal
                    during demonstrations or crowd events." The use of force policies of the other law enforcement agencies could not immediately be determined. Norris said he doesn’t know who fired at him. Shot without warning Soren Stevenson, 25, said
                    he was unarmed when he was shot by law enforcement May 31 in Minneapolis. Protesters were peaceful but unnerved by police in riot gear, Stevenson said. He moved to the front of the crowd, about 30 feet from police, to protect protesters
                    behind him. Suddenly, officers launched two explosive devices at demonstrators. Tear gas filled the air. “The police knew it was a peaceful protest,” Stevenson said. "I did not hear any instructions or commands from police. It went
                    from protest to shooting, just like that.” Stevenson said he was trying to comprehend the explosions when something slammed into his face, knocking the lenses from his glasses and spinning him around. “I was very confused. I reached
                    up and touched my face, and it was just soft — that whole left side," he said. "It broke a lot of bones in my face, and my nose was moved from where it belongs to underneath my right eye.” Stevenson doubled over, but stayed on his
                    feet. He said he didn’t notice blood or pain until volunteers cleansed the wound at a medic station. Stevenson said there were fractures to his skull, cheekbone, nose and jaw. He also suffered a concussion. Doctors immediately performed
                    reconstructive surgery. On June 10, surgeons took out Stevenson’s eye. They inserted a prosthetic that is expected to eventually settle with surrounding tissue, and he’ll get a glass lens at some point. But he’ll never again have normal
                    vision. In three decades as an ophthalmologist, "I've seen just about everything bad that can happen to an eye," said Dr. George Williams, who has not been involved in Stevenson's care. "I can't imagine a more effective way to destroy
                    an eyeball than these so-called kinetic impact technologies." "Frankly, you're better off being stabbed in the eye with something sharp that creates a clean, plain wound," said Williams, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy
                    of Ophthalmology. "This creates irregular wounds where the tissue is just blown out. There is oftentimes nothing left to fix." His group and Physicians for Human Rights have called for a ban on less-lethal projectiles, including sponge-tipped
                    bullets, pepper-spray balls and bean bag rounds. These projectiles "don't seem to be very effective at crowd control," Williams said. "All they seem to do is hurt people." Frozen with fear Nadia Rohr, 24, froze when Detroit police
                    aimed what looked like "a bright-orange Nerf gun" directly at her. She and her girlfriend were at the front of a group of marchers when they turned a corner and came face-to-face with a wall of police in full riot gear, banging their
                    batons on their shields. "I locked eyes with a police officer," said Rohr, who said she was peaceful and unarmed at the May 31 protest. "I was in a direct line of fire.” Rohr said her girlfriend tried to pull her away, but the projectile
                    still hit her in the back of the head. According to Rohr's medical records, the projectile fractured her skull, caused bleeding beneath the outer lining of her brain and ripped a deep gash across her scalp that took nine stitches to
                    close. The Detroit Police Department didn't respond to requests to review its policy. Guidelines from 2014 authorize Detroit officers to use less-lethal force only to protect someone from physical harm, stop dangerous or criminal behavior
                    or control someone resisting arrest. C.J. Montano, 24, has a bruise on his forehead in the shape of a circle — visible evidence of the projectile that caused bleeding inside his brain. "They shot me directly in the face," said Montano,
                    a former Marine who was hospitalized in the intensive care unit after attending a May 30 protest in Los Angeles. "It was definitely intentional." Montano described a chaotic scene. He and a group of nonviolent protesters knelt on the
                    ground, yelling and chanting, about 5 feet from a line of officers armed with projectile launchers. Nearby, other protesters were throwing water bottles at police — mostly Los Angeles officers, though some sheriff's deputies were there
                    too, Montano said. Montano said he told police he would ask the protesters to stop throwing water bottles at the police if the officers didn't shoot him. He did so, but they shot him anyway with small projectiles, he said. The police
                    announced they would move forward, and he warned the crowd that they would have to back up. As the crowd moved back amid tear gas, he and another man were left in a no man's land, 50 feet from police and another 50 feet away from the
                    crowd, Montano said. Officers shot again. "I got hit in the hip and the stomach at the same time with larger rounds," Montano said. "They shot the other gentleman. Although my hands were up, they shot me in the rib cage. I fell on
                    the ground and moved behind a sign to catch my breath. … Their shots were getting higher and higher every time I stood up." Five minutes later, Montano said, he stood up with his hands in the air. He said that's when he felt a powerful
                    force hit his forehead. "It was just like a really, really hard thud," Montano said. "I lost all vision in my left eye, all hearing in my left ear." The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating 56 allegations of misconduct by
                    officers during the protests that decried police brutality — half of which involved alleged use of force. The problem with police response in many cities was that leaders assumed crowds would be hostile, said Chris Stone, a criminal
                    justice expert and professor at the University of Oxford. Stone sat on a panel that reviewed the death of a woman in Boston who was shot with a pepper ball in the early 2000s. Uniform standards for using less-lethal projectiles would
                    go a long way in “strengthening professionalism, strengthening proportionalism and a reasonable response to the protests,” he said. Officers violated rules against shooting nonviolent people Montano's description of the shooting appears
                    to violate the Los Angeles Police Department's policy, which explicitly prohibits police from using pepper-spray balls, sponge and foam projectiles and other less-lethal force against people who passively resist or disobey them. According
                    to the Los Angeles policy, police should fire projectiles only "if an officer reasonably believes that a suspect or subject is violently resisting arrest or poses an immediate threat of violence or physical harm.” Demonstrators in
                    Minneapolis, San Jose, Denver and Dallas described being shot with less-lethal projectiles even though those departments don't allow them to be used against nonviolent people. In some cases, such as in Denver and Minneapolis, law enforcement
                    from other agencies were called in to help and it's unclear who fired. In San Jose, attorney Sarah Marinho, who is representing Sanderlin, said that police violated their rules when they shot him, that he was armed only with a small
                    cardboard sign. At the time he was shot, Sanderlin was begging police to stop firing at unarmed people, including women, at close range. "The facts are not in dispute," said Marinho, noting that a TV news team recorded the scene. "He
                    was a safe distance away. He was not invading the police officers' space." A San Jose police duty manual states that specially trained officers may fire projectiles against people when suspects are "armed with a weapon likely to cause
                    serious bodily injury or death" or in "situations where its use is likely to prevent any person from being seriously injured." In an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, Sanderlin said he stepped between protesters and the police
                    to ask them to stop firing at peaceful demonstrators, including a woman who had been hit in the chest. Police told him to move, he said. "I shook my head, held my sign over my chest, and thought, 'I really hope this guy doesn't shoot
                    me,’" said Sanderlin, who volunteers with a group that trains San Jose police recruits on how to avoid racial bias. "He fired off a rubber bullet, and I realized he wasn't aiming for my chest. I was hit directly in the groin." San
                    Jose police have said they are investigating the shooting; they did not return phone calls for this story. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo tweeted, "What happened to Derrick Sanderlin was wrong," and he pledged to push for a ban on less-lethal
                    projectiles. Stephen James, an assistant research professor at Washington State University, said he was disheartened to see countless videos showing "officers appearing to indiscriminately use pepper balls as if they were paint-balling
                    on a Sunday afternoon." Police departments have more trouble enforcing discipline with weapons during protests or riots because officers almost never train for those circumstances, may be fatigued and often are fearful, he said. Though
                    these projectiles should never be used to disperse a crowd, he said, they do have an important role in the law enforcement arsenal. If police are heavily outnumbered in riot or protest situations, less-lethal firearms can be used as
                    a "credible threat" to maintain safety and order. "I would never advocate for taking them away," James said. "If you take away less-lethal weapons, then deadly force is the fallback." Learning from the past For residents and police
                    in Baltimore, Floyd's killing recalled one of the city's most painful moments. Five years earlier, Baltimore erupted in violence after a man named Freddie Gray died in police custody. A Justice Department investigation concluded Baltimore
                    police had routinely violated residents' constitutional rights, discriminated against blacks and used excessive force. Baltimore brought in new leadership. Community groups began working with police. Policies changed. And after video
                    showed a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck, a curious thing happened in Baltimore: Demonstrations were peaceful. There are no accounts of police firing less-lethal weapons. Erricka Bridgeford, founder of the
                    Baltimore Ceasefire 365 anti-violence group, said officers marched and knelt with protesters, prompting cheers from the crowd. "They allowed people space to yell and vent their pain," she said. Baltimore now has strict rules governing
                    the use of kinetic impact projectiles. In the police department's use-of-force policies, the No. 1 principle is the "sanctity of human life." Whenever a less-lethal weapon is fired in the line of duty, it must be reported and investigated
                    within 24 hours. Bridgeford said she was heartbroken when she saw police in other cities shooting demonstrators with rubber bullets and pepper-spray balls. She didn't call them "less lethal," saying those words make police feel free
                    to open fire. Those weapons are used to instill fear, she said, "like siccing dogs on people or pulling out water hoses." The weapons aren't "a way to de-escalate. It's a way to harm people," Bridgeford said. "Treating a crowd of people
                    like animals? 'Oh, my God, they're shooting into the crowd!' How is that a good strategy?" Kaiser Health NewsThis article was reprinted from khn.org with permission from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Kaiser Health News, an
